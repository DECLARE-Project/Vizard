# Vizard
A declarative reporting tool that utilizes user concerns to express demands of a user.

Running examples can be found on the following pages:
- Specifying performance concerns and generating experiments for JMeter and Locust ([link](http://declare-project.github.io/Vizard/Definition))
- Report generation (and concern refinement, if possible) ([link](http://declare-project.github.io/Vizard/Report))
